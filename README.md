# Health Information Delivery

-This is an honours project for the module AC40001 Individual Project at the University of Dundee

-There are currently many mobile applications which deliver health information to their user in a way that is inaccessible to many adults who have mild cognitive impairments. The aim of this project is to design and create an android health information application which is accessible to adults with mild cognitive impairments. This will allow the users of the application to easily keep track of the steps that they have walked, their activity times, the number of fruit or vegetables they have eaten and glasses of water they have drank in a day. The user will have targets and will be rewarded for meeting these targets.

This project connects with the google fit api to keep track of step count and activity time. All other data is stored locally to limit the use of the phones network.
